## Project Overview

This Python file reads Excel data pulled from Kaggle and cleans it. The file focuses mainly on data about production and consumption, along 
with GDP from countries. In total, around 80 countries were pulled, which were subsequently grouped by GDP. Then charts were
generated of the share of energy production by source for each country, global oil production since 1900, and renewable energy
consumption among the largest economies in the world.
